# Specification for a distributed secret management system with sharing capabilities

This repository hosts my **work-in-progress** bachelor thesis. I intend to
specify a system for sharing secrets, such as passwords, with other people via
a distributed network of machines. Basically a password manager for teams, that
stores your passwords where *you* want them.

For questions, feedback, etc please open an [issue on
github](https://github.com/opatut/bsc/issues/new).
