\section{State of the Art}

To my knowledge there is currently no system that exhibits the desired
features. However, there are lots of tools that provide a partial featureset.
Here is a small overview, the best of these tools combined may be a good
starting point for the newly designed system:

\textbf{OpenPGP}\cite{openpgp} is a widespread standard for personal message
encryption and signing. I have found implementations of password managers using
OpenPGP, such as pass\footnote{\url{http://passwordstore.org}}. Another notable
password manager is KeePass\footnote{\url{http://keepass.info/}}, with a well
defined file format, and a synchronization plugin (though this is single-user
only).

There are many different code version control systems, such as git
\footnote{\url{https://git-scm.com/}} and Apache
Subversion\footnote{\url{https://subversion.apache.org/}} that provide
mechanisms for both distributed storage (and sharing) and conflict resolution.
I expect to be able to adapt one of these mechanisms to the problem at hand.
