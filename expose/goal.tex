\section{Goal}

The goal of this work is to specify a protocol for a distributed system that
resolves the introduced problems. A system following that protocol shall be
able to synchronize secrets in a secure manner, such that multiple people can
concurrently access and modify those secrets.

This system shall exhibit these main features:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Security}: Since the system is handling secrets, the solution
        must provide secure storage and transmission. This is the core priority
        of the protocol.

    \item \textbf{Distributed storage}: The storage shall be distributed, i.e.\ 
        accessible from different devices, and synchronizable across those
        devices. 

    \item \textbf{Sharing}: It must be possible to share secrets with other
        people, in a manner that ensures those people can access the secret.
        
    \item \textbf{Conflict resolution}: The system must provide conflict
        resolution routines, that is, specify how to handle the event of
        different changes to the same secret to reach a consistent state.

\end{itemize}

I will also provide an example implementation of this specification.
